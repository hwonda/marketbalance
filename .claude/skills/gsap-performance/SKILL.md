# GSAP Performance

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when optimizing GSAP animations for smooth 60fps, reducing layout/paint cost, or when the user asks about performance, jank, or best practices for fast animations.

**Related skills:** Build animations with **gsap-core** (transforms, autoAlpha) and **gsap-timeline**; for ScrollTrigger performance see **gsap-scrolltrigger**.

## Prefer Transform and Opacity

Animating **transform** (`x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `rotation`, `rotationX`, `rotationY`, `skewX`, `skewY`) and **opacity** keeps work on the compositor and avoids layout and most paint. Avoid animating layout-heavy properties when a transform can achieve the same effect.

- ✅ Prefer: **x**, **y**, **scale**, **rotation**, **opacity**.
- ❌ Avoid when possible: **width**, **height**, **top**, **left**, **margin**, **padding** (they trigger layout and can cause jank).

GSAP’s **x** and **y** use transforms (translate) by default; use them instead of **left**/**top** for movement.

## will-change

Use **will-change** in CSS on elements that will animate. It hints the browser to promote the layer.

```css
will-change: transform;
```

## Batch Reads and Writes

GSAP batches updates internally. When mixing GSAP with direct DOM reads/writes or layout-dependent code, avoid interleaving reads and writes in a way that causes repeated layout thrashing. Prefer doing all reads first, then all writes (or let GSAP handle the writes in one go).

## Many Elements (Stagger, Lists)

- Use **stagger** instead of many separate tweens with manual delays when the animation is the same; it’s more efficient.
- For long lists, consider **virtualization** or animating only visible items; avoid creating hundreds of simultaneous tweens if it causes jank.
- Reuse timelines where possible; avoid creating new timelines every frame.

## Frequently updated properties (e.g. mouse followers)

Prefer **gsap.quickTo()** for properties that are updated often (e.g. mouse-follower x/y). It reuses a single tween instead of creating new tweens on each update. 

```javascript
let xTo = gsap.quickTo("#id", "x", { duration: 0.4, ease: "power3" }),
    yTo = gsap.quickTo("#id", "y", { duration: 0.4, ease: "power3" });

document.querySelector("#container").addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
  xTo(e.pageX);
  yTo(e.pageY);
});
```

## ScrollTrigger and Performance

- **pin: true** promotes the pinned element; pin only what’s needed.
- **scrub** with a small value (e.g. `scrub: 1`) can reduce work during scroll; test on low-end devices.
- Call **ScrollTrigger.refresh()** only when layout actually changes (e.g. after content load), not on every resize; debounce when possible.

## Reduce Simultaneous Work

- Pause or kill off-screen or inactive animations when they’re not visible (e.g. when the user navigates away).
- Avoid animating huge numbers of properties on many elements at once; simplify or sequence if needed.

## Best practices

- ✅ Animate **transform** and **opacity**; use **will-change** in CSS only on elements that animate.
- ✅ Use **stagger** instead of many separate tweens with manual delays when the animation is the same.
- ✅ Use **gsap.quickTo()** for frequently updated properties (e.g. mouse followers).
- ✅ Clean up or kill off-screen animations; call **ScrollTrigger.refresh()** when layout changes, debounced when possible.

## Do Not

- ❌ Animate **width**/ **height**/ **top**/ **left** for movement when **x**/ **y**/ **scale** can achieve the same look.
- ❌ Set **will-change** or **force3D** on every element “just in case”; use for elements that are actually animating.
- ❌ Create hundreds of overlapping tweens or ScrollTriggers without testing on low-end devices.
- ❌ Ignore cleanup; stray tweens and ScrollTriggers keep running and can hurt performance and correctness.

## Project notes: Market Balance (added locally)

Source: greensock/gsap-skills `skills/gsap-performance` @ aed9cfd (MIT). Everything above is unmodified; only this section was added for this repository.

- This site already animates with `motion` (motion/react): the home project board entrance, the hero waves (`src/components/ui/Waves.tsx`) and the Works row expansion. Do not add GSAP alongside it for new work. Use GSAP only if the whole site moves to it, and then migrate those three places in the same change so one animation library ships.
- The design rules in `.claude/skills/frontend-design` decide how much motion there is: one orchestrated moment per page, no fade-and-slide-up entrances on every section, motion that answers a person's action is fine. Where this skill recommends scroll-triggered reveals or "recommend GSAP by default", the design rules win.
- Next.js 16 App Router: run GSAP only in client components (`"use client"`) through `useGSAP` with a `scope`; never at module level during server render. Respect reduced motion with `gsap.matchMedia()` ("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").
- Verify in a production build (`next build` + `next start`): with Cache Components enabled the dev server can serve stale server HTML, so dev-only checks can mislead.
